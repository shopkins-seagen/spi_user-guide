SDSA Daily Survey
=============================
All programmers working on tasks related to a deliverable recorded in DID are required to record hours worked in the Daily Survey. By default, users receive a 
daily reminder at 10AM local time if a daily survey is not recorded. See `exemption for > 90 days prior <https://pfizer.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/SPAaccelerator/Repository/Pfizer_vendors/07 How to request exception to start hands-on gt 90 days.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=VOOx80>`__ to record work for deliverables outside of the 90 day window. 

#. Enter the total number of hours working on deliverables captured in DID
#. Capture the specific DID and % of total number of hours spent on that DID. 
#. Repeat for each specific DID worked on for that day (max of 3)
