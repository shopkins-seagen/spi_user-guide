SDTM Unique CRF Annotator
=====================================
The SDTM Unique CRF Annotation(Annotator) service provides functionality to create a specification file to map the forms and fields to the SDTM annotations, and generate the 
annotated PDF from the unique CRF PDF from DM and the completed specification file. The app also creates visit and domain bookmarks in the annotated CRF. Prior to starting, the 
programmer should copy the following files to the SP study area:

* `Unique CRF <annotate_crf.html#unique-crf-pdf>`__ created by data management 
* `SDS file <createspecs.html#the-sds-spreadsheet>`__ created by EDC programmer 
* `CRF tree <createspecs.html#the-crf-tree-spreadsheet>`__ created by data management

With those file in place, the programmer can begin process of generating the annotated CRF.
