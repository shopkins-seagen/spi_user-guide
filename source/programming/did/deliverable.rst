Create a Deliverable
===============================
Once the study exists, the L-SLP creates an entry for each planned deliverable. 

Naming Conventions
--------------------------------------
The DID name must match the protocol name with an incremental integer representing 
each deliverable. For the first deliverable for study PFE1234, the DID entry is PFE1234_1. For each new deliverable, increment the suffix by one. The 
second deliverable would be PFE1234_2. 

Timelines
----------------------------
While there are no timeline constraints for recording studies, when entering deliverables into DID, timelines need to be carefully considered and planned. 

* Delivery timeline is more than 1 year away: don't enter them into DID. 
* Delivery timeline is within 1 year: enter them into DID. 

.. note::

    * Timeline is within 90 days: daily survey is required and programmers must complete their daily survey.
    * Timeline is between 90 days to 6 months: Daily survey is not required. However, SLP may request an exception for resource use in this time frame. See the training video See `How to request exception to start hands-on > 90 days.mp4 <https://pfizer.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/SPAaccelerator/Repository/Pfizer_vendors/07%20How%20to%20request%20exception%20to%20start%20hands-on%20gt%2090%20days.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=9v5DPV>`__
    * Timeline is between 6 months and 1 year: Programmers cannot enter daily survey. 

Note that for any analysis, e.g., a primary analysis (PA), with the final delivery timeline greater than 90 days 
especially greater than 6 months away, if programmers are actively working on the analysis, SLP may consider creating 
short-term (within 90 days) deliverables which should be subsets of the final deliverable. For example, if a PA CSR delivery is more than 6 
months away, but the study team will be delivering SDTM within 90 days, create the SDTM deliverable for the CSR and select the delivery content to be Only SDTM. 
Similarly, the study team may create another short-term deliverable for Only ADaM or Only TLFs as needed. A single CSR could have additional multiple 
smaller deliverables, each with a different subset of the CSR content.

Steps to Create a Deliverable in DID
----------------------------------------------
#. From the `Studies/Assets Page <https://pfizer.sharepoint.com/sites/SDSADIDManagement/Lists/DID_0/DID_0.aspx>`__ , click the *DID_N* link to bring up the Deliverables page.
#. Click the |new| icon to create a new Deliverable.
#. Select the study from the dropdown. 
#. Select the Reporting Event that most closely aligns with the L-Seagen deliverable.. 
#. Select the planned deliverable date
#. Set delivery content as applicable.

#. Click |save| to create the deliverable. 
#. You will see the study has a Submit button in the grid view of the study deliverables page. Prior to submitting the approval request, follow the steps 
   to `upload LoT <lot.html#upload-the-lot-to-did-repository>`__. Once uploaded, then return back to DID_0 to click the Submit button.
