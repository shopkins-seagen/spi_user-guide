Create a Study or Asset
=====================================================
Studies can be captured in DID tool at any time. There are no timeline constraints as there are for deliverables. 

#. From `SDSA DID Managment Home Page <https://pfizer.sharepoint.com/sites/SDSADIDManagement>`__ , click the DID_0 icon navigate to the Studies/Assest page. 

#. Click the |new| icon to create a new Study. Use the corresponding Pfizer study number for study name if available. If there is no Pfizer number, use the L-Seagen protocol name. If you do not know the Pfizer ID for your protocol, you can look it up in the `L-Seagen -> Pfizer Mapping document <https://seagen.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/StatProg/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7bF25E609F-1E1B-4F3A-AE4E-09CFAE96D0EF%7d&file=seagen-pfizer-study-ids.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&web=1>`__

#. Record the study lead programmer in the SDSL and SDSA US PoC fields. The remaining fields are not used by L-Seagen studies.
