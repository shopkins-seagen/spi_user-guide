SAS Programming Environment
====================================

Initialization
-------------------------
The first line of code in every SAS program in a pgms or testing subfolder is **%include "init.sas"**. The implicit path for this file is on the SAS application server under the
[SAS]\\Config\\Lev1\\[server]. The init macro creates macro variables that define the calling program's location, which in turn includes *link.sas*.   Link.sas defines the ROOT macro variable and includes 
[root]\\utilities\tools\\env.sas. The *env.sas* program is responsible for initializing the SAS programming environment. Lastly, env.sas includes *init_supp.sas*, which provides enables the programmer to 
customize the environment. See figure for initalization flow (:ref:`env_init`).

Init_supp.sas
-----------------
The init_sup.sas file provides a place to extend the default environment. Use this file to define supplemental elements (e.g. macro variables,
fileref, librefs, ect..) centrally rather than in individual files. The following are some guidelines for using init_supp 


* Declare macro variable %global prior to assignment to ensure they are in the scope of the calling program:

      .. code-block::

            %global mvar;
            %let mvar=my value;

* Assign the value of *dbl_date* and *dco_date* in ISO format, i.e., 2020-05-20 instead of 20MAY2020, as standard analysis-level variables
* Avoid defining macros within the init_supp.sas file, use the autocall folder for this activity
* Use macro variables to create dynamic paths instead of defining static paths. This will enable init_supp.sas to function seamlessly when copied to another version within the analysis. Always consider if the 
  code will execute without change in a new version. For example, if you wanted to create a reference to a history folder under \\data\\adam, use the macro variables created from env.sas:

      .. code-block::

         %let histpath=&root.\&draft.\data\adam\history;
         %sysexec md "&histpath" ;
         libname history "&histpath";

Macro variables
-------------------------------
Env.sas defines an abundance of macro variables intended to allow programmers to create dynamic programs that will work seamless when moved between versions, or even analyses. 

Static macro variables 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Static macro variables are defined in the ALM v3 :ref:`alm_mvar` View. Contact SPI for assistance with modification of the department macro variables. 

Dyanamic macro variables 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Dynamic macro variables are defined by the application at executing time based on the selections made during the creation of the folder structure using ALM.

Dynamic macro variables from Folder Template
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
These macro variables are declared in the folder template and assigned at execution time based on the selections made during the creation of the folder structure using ALM. Different 
templates will have different macro variables. Below is and example of the types of macro variables created using the *Stat Programming* template:

Library References
-----------------------------
The library references created in env.sas are the result of the template used to create the folder structure in ALM. Below are examples of typical librefs defined in env.sas 
created using the *Stat Programming* template

Non-utility librefs at the analysis level
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

      CDM         [source data path] can be anywhere, but typically under data management
      OUT         The only writeable libref. For SAS program in a â€˜pgmsâ€™ subfolder, OUT is one level above the calling programâ€™s location. For SAS programs in a â€˜testingâ€™ subfolder, OUT is the same folder as the calling programâ€™s location.

      OUT         The only writeable libref. For SAS program in a â€˜pgmsâ€™ subfolder, OUT is one level above the calling programâ€™s location. For SAS programs in a â€˜testingâ€™ subfolder, OUT is the same folder as the calling programâ€™s location.
      UP          One level about the calling program                  
      =========== =============================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Utility librefs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
The utility librefs are concatenated references to the utility\\[category] subfolder from the version to the department level. 

=========== =============== =====================================================
Libname     Description     Location
=========== =============== =====================================================
L           Reference data  \\utilities\\lookups

Localization effect on the folder hierarchy
--------------------------------------------------
In the pre-localized state, the hierarchy extends from the version to the department level. Precedence is given to objects closest to the calling program in the event of collisions. Regardless of 
localization state, the same precedence is maintained for programs under the analysis level. 

.. image:: pre-archive-state.png


After localization, the precedence is maintained, but all the dependencies are moved to level-specific subfolder within the version folder
